        <p><strong>Once you place an order a member of our team will reach out immediately to confirm details.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We will ask for details to contact you to ensure on time and correct delivery.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>On Delivery Day a member of our team will reach out given your provided contact to ask when and where you want your package delivered.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Our goal is to make sure you can get packages as quick as possible with as much as ease as living at home.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The school delivery system takes longer to process, isn't available every day, and takes up your time getting and signing for a package through an outdated system. DormDrop cuts all of that out.</strong></p>
